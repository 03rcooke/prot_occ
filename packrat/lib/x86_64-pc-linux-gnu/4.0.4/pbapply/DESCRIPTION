Description: A lightweight package that adds progress bar to vectorized
    R functions ('*apply'). The implementation can easily be added to
    functions where showing the progress is useful (e.g. bootstrap).
    The type and style of the progress bar (with percentages or
    remaining time) can be set through options. Supports several
    parallel processing backends.
