Title: Interface to 'Lp_solve' v. 5.5 to Solve Linear/Integer Programs
Author: Michel Berkelaar and others
Maintainer: Gábor Csárdi <csardi.gabor@gmail.com>
Description: Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for
    solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this
    implementation we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R
    functions that solve general linear/integer problems, assignment
    problems, and transportation problems. This version calls lp_solve
    version 5.5.
