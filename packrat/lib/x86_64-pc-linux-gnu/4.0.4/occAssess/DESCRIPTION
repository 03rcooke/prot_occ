Description: Contains a number of discrete functions, each of which can
    be used to assess a particular form of bias, uncertainty or
    coverage. Generally, the user must pass their occurrence data to
    the functions along with a list of time periods into which the
    outputs will be split. The functions generally return a list with
    two elements: a ggplot2 object, and the data that underpins that
    plot.
